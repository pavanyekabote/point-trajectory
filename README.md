# point-trajectory
Built with p5.js 

Hello,

This was started as some fun project, but as the development process continued, the growth of information included in this became huge.
Like the mathematical calculations, the trajectories even more.

Initially my goal was to make a point travel on a circumference of a circle.

As soon as I started to build it, I came to know the real requirements for that to happen, was TRIGONOMETRY. Then I blew out
dust from my old school concepts on Point in Space. And how a point on circle is formed by both Cos and Sin thethas together.
